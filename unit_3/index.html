		<p class="paragraphs"> I am a freelance biomedical illustrator from northern Illinois. I typically illustrate wildlife and anatomy. However, I enjoy all sciences and a broad range of subjects for illustration. I graduated from Kendall College of Art and Design and Michigan State University with my BFA in Medical Illustration and a focus in Scientific Illustration. I am skilled in both traditional and digital media, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, watercolor, gouache, pen, and pencil. I love researching scientific material to create art while learning in the process. Color is a big inspiration to me, as well as fine detail.</p>

		<p class="paragraphs">I am always looking for new opportunities to use my skills for professional projects. Send me an email at <a href="mailto:caitrausch@gmail.com?subject=Hi there!">caitrausch@gmail.com</a> and we can get to work!</p>
