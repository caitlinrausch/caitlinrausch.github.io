		<p> I am a freelance biomedical illustrator from northern Illinois. Biomedical illustration in my work covers any medical or scientific topics, with a focus in anatomy and biology. However, I enjoy all sciences and a broad range of subjects for illustration. I graduated from Kendall College of Art and Design and Michigan State University with my BFA in Medical Illustration and a focus in Scientific Illustration. I also worked in Michigan State University's cadaver lab as a human prosector and student aid. This experience, along with my pre-med classes at MSU, provided me with hands on knowledge and experience that translates to my work. I am skilled in both traditional and digital media, including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, watercolor painting, pen, and pencil. Watercolor and pen are my favorite media to use, but I also enjoy the capabilities of digital art. I love researching scientific material to create art while learning in the process. Color is a big inspiration to me, as well as fine detail.</p>

		<p>I am always looking for new opportunities to use my skills for professional projects. Send me an email at <a href="mailto:caitrausch@gmail.com?subject=Hi there!">caitrausch@gmail.com</a> and we can get to work!</p>
