		<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>I am a full time graphic designer and freelance scientific illustrator. I typically illustrate wildlife and anatomy, with a special interest in ornithology. I graduated from Kendall College of Art and Design and Michigan State University with my BFA in Medical Illustration and a focus in Scientific Illustration. I am skilled in both traditional and digital techniques, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, watercolor, gouache, pen, and pencil. Color is an inspiration, as well as fine detail.</p>
